# 🌍 Global Energy Consumption & Emission Analysis Using SQL  
A comprehensive end-to-end SQL project analyzing global **energy consumption, production, emissions, GDP**, and **population** trends across multiple countries.  
This project highlights how nations use energy, how economic factors influence demand, and how sustainability patterns evolve globally.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights  
- 📊 Built a **fully relational SQL database** with 6 interconnected tables  
- 🔍 Performed **complex analytical queries** with joins & window functions  
- 🌱 Identified **major pollution sources** & global emission contributors  
- 📈 Analyzed **GDP–Energy–Population relationships**  
- 🌎 Compared countries on **per-capita, production, and efficiency metrics**  
- 🔥 Delivered **30+ actionable insights** through SQL analysis

## 🗂️ Database Architecture  
The project uses a multi-table schema ensuring referential integrity:

- **country_3** → Country master  
- **emission_3** → Emissions by energy type 
- **production_3** → Energy production  
- **consum_3** → Energy consumption  
- **population_3** → Population data  
- **gdp_3** → GDP data  

Each dataset is connected using **foreign key relationships** for accurate trend analysis.

## 📊 Sample SQL Queries  

### ▶ Top 5 Countries by GDP
```sql
SELECT country, value AS gdp
FROM gdp_3
WHERE year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM gdp_3)
ORDER BY value DESC
LIMIT 5;
